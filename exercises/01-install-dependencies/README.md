# `01` Install dependencies

The first thing you need to do is to install a series of dependencies that are necessary for the operation of the web server and Wordpress specifically. The necessary packages are the following

- **Apache2**: Apache2 is a free and open source web server software that powers much of the internet. It serves web pages, handles user requests and manages web traffic.

- **MariaDB-server**: MariaDB-server is a free and open source relational database management system, compatible with MySQL.

- **php**: PHP is an open source programming language for dynamic web development. Since it is the language in which Wordpress is written, we need the interpreter to run it.

- **php-mysqli**: This is an extension that allows PHP applications (like Wordpress) to access mysql and mariadb databases.
